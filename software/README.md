# eXaDrums: Software Drum Module

The heart of the eXaDrums software is _libexadrums_: a library that embeds a software drum module. It doesn't run on its own, and is mainly controlled by another program called _exadrum_.

_Exadrums_ is the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of _libexadrums_, in other words: it is what you see. If you are a drummer, you probably want to play drums right away, so you can go to the [installation](#installation) section. If you are a developer, you are most likely interested in _libexadrums_, you can read the [Developers section](#developers).

## Installation

### Debian, Ubuntu, and Raspberry Pi OS

Some Debian-based Linux distributions already ship with exadrums. So, if you are using Debian, Raspbian (or Raspberry Pi OS) Bullseye (or newer) or Ubuntu >= 19.10, all you have to do is to install the exadrums package via the software center, or using the terminal:

```bash
sudo apt install exadrums
```
